# üîç How to Research and Vote on Upcoming Projects

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide assumes you have already purchased and Staked BUIDL on Starter.  Please read the "[**Tiers & Staking**](../overview/tiers-and-staking.md)["](../overview/tiers-and-staking.md) guide for more details.
{% endhint %}

Staking at least 5000 BUIDL tokens on Starter gives you the right to Vote on which projects are approved for a presale.  The voting process is quick and simple, but the due diligence you perform prior to voting should be thorough!

* Go to the Starter website (https://starter.xyz[^1])
* Connect your Web3 wallet (we will be using MetaMask in this guide but Coinbase Wallet can also be used) and make sure your network is set to Base mainnet. A guide for setting this up is located on the sidebar.
* Next, Click on the "**Research**" tab to pull up a list of all the pending presales that are eligible for voting and needs to be researched.

* Select the project you wish to vote for and thoroughly review the terms and relevant links.
* In the "**Your Investment**" section, you can see how many BUIDL you have staked on the platform.  This is your voting weight.
  * _e.g. 1000 BUIDL = 1000 Votes_
* Click on the "**VOTE**" button to pull up the Confirmation box that reminds you of the due diligence every investor should perform prior to voting.‚Äã
* Once you have made your decision, make your voice heard by clicking "**Yes**" or "**No**" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

* Once the transaction is confirmed, your votes will be added to the totals in the project.
* Congratulations! Your part of the voting process is complete.  Now just wait for the project voting timer to end to see the result!
