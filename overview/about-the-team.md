# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë About the Team

Starter Labs (https://starterlabs.xyz) is a US-based company specializing in the research and development for blockchain-based products. Our sister company, Starter International, Ltd. is a BVI-based company specializing in token-based project launches. We launched our first IDO and vesting products in February 2021 as a decentralized launchpad initially for Binance Smart Chain, followed by Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, and Ethereum, eventually growing to 18 full-time staff and becoming [the #1 launchpad in the blockchain industry by Q4'2021](https://twitter.com/Gems\_Street/status/1457717518932398081) based on ROI, according to a CryptoRank report.

As a completely global launchpad, most of our launches were from founders we had never met. Therefore, we embarked on a new journey to build IRL! Our latest initiative initiated during the bear market of 2022 was establishing a physical building in the heart of Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Atlanta is home to the _**#1 most busiest airport in the world**_ (ATL-Hartsfield); the _**#4 top engineering school in the USA**_ (Georgia Tech); _**70% of the world‚Äôs financial payment transactions**_; the _**civil rights movement**_; and _**leading artists and blockbuster movies**_ created over the last decade. [**Crypto** **pioneers such as Jeff Garzik**](https://twitter.com/cz\_binance/status/1603101415391444993?s=20) (who worked with Satoshi on Bitcoin Core); Craig Sellars (co founder of Tether); and others are from the Atlanta area.

Called [Atlanta Blockchain Center](https://atlantachain.io/), we operate the first and only blockchain-focused coworking space, incubator, and events center in [the fintech payments capital of the United States](https://fintechatlanta.org/#bythenumbers) (Atlanta, GA). Every Thursday, we host **in-person events** with leading industry speakers to help educate our members and offer networking and community building opportunities. [Some of our past speakers](https://atlantachain.io/events) include BitBoy Crypto, Jeff Garzik, CleanSpark, Coinbase Ventures, Binance US, the FBI, Salesforce, Mastercard and many others. We also operate an incubator and college scholars program that have been quite successful.
