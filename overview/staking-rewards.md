# üßë‚Äçüåæ Staking Rewards

You can earn additional BUIDL for staking and locking BUIDL or BUIDL/ETH LP. Earned BUIDL rewards are subject to a 0.50% unstaking burn fee.

* The single-sided BUIDL staking is allocated 40% of the total rewards available.
* The BUIDL/ETH LP staking pool is allocated 60% of the total rewards available.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: To extend the duration of staking rewards, the BUIDL reward rates issued per block is reduced by 3% every two weeks.
{% endhint %}

Earned rewards can be claimed as liquid BUIDL tokens after a vesting period has expired. The length of the vesting period is determined based on the length of the lock ‚Äî the longer you keep your deposit locked (maximum of 1 year), the lower the vesting period and the faster you receive your rewards.

For example, if you stake 10000 BUIDL for 30 days, the vesting on your BUIDL rewards will be 335 days. If you stake 10000 BUIDL for 365 days, the vesting on your BUIDL rewards will only be 45 days and you earn the full 10x multiple.

Unstaking BUIDL is subject to a burn fee according to your last unstaked time or the last time you participated in an IDO (unstaking LP tokens are not subject to any burning). The unstaking burn fee is applied according to the rules below.
