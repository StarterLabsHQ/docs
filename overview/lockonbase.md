By default, LockOnBase charges a small 0.5% tax on all deposits in its locker. To avoid paying the locker deposit fee, you can stake a minimum of 10000 BUIDL tokens in the system.

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Token Address**_ - paste the token contract address of the token you would like to lock. This can be any valid ERC20 token address. If the token is valid, LockOnBase will show a preview of the token's name, symbol, and your balance below the Token Address field.

_**Lock Amount**_ - enter the amount of tokens you would like to lock. Or click the Max button to lock all the tokens in the currently connected wallet.

_**Unlock Date**_ - enter the number of days you would like to lock this token. For example, enter 30 to lock the token for 1 month; 90 to lock for 3 months or 365 to lock for an entire year.

Once you're done, click the **Lock** button to initiate the transfer into the locker.&#x20;
