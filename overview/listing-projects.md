## Apply for a Certified BUIDLer Listing

Certified BUIDLer IDOs are not required to go through the voting process and can only be created by our team. If you would like to apply for a Certified BUIDLer IDO with Starter, you can apply here: [**Certified BUIDLer Application**](https://tinyurl.com/BaseCertifiedBUIDLer)

Or...

## Create your IDO pool using the self-service method

Launching an IDO on Starter is a fairly straight-forward process:

To skip straight to the onchain form, visit the website and connect your wallet, then use <img src="broken-reference" alt="" data-size="original"> in the top right of your browser [or ](https://starter.xyz/#/apply)otherwise, refer to the below prior to completing the application to understand the listing process and requirements **before** applying.

* **You need to have a minimum of Gold Tier in order to create an onchain listing** (_see the_ [_**Stake page**_](../product-guides/how-to-stake-tokens-and-secure-your-tier.md) _for more information_)
* Upon application submission, your presale smart contract is generated according to the terms outlined in the form fields.
* **Community members who stake at least 5000 BUIDL on the platform have the opportunity to perform due diligence on your project and vote "Yes" or "No" on your listing. (Unless you are a Certified BUIDLer or Degen listing in which case voting wont be required)**
* Votes are weighted by the amount of BUIDL tokens each voter has staked.
* **The voting formula for whether your presale will proceed is as follows:**
  * "Yes" votes minus "No" votes must be greater than 20,000,000 (10% of the max supply)

**\*Before applying, we highly recommend you read our Top Tips on Creating a Successful IDO here:** [https://starterxyz.medium.com/how-to-create-a-successful-ido-with-starter-c17901f95796](https://starterxyz.medium.com/how-to-create-a-successful-ido-with-starter-c17901f95796)

  _- **Token Sale** - Use this option to hold a seed or private sale, optionally limited to whitelisted addresses only. Requires community voting to get funded and investors must be staking in one of our_ [_Staking Tiers_](tiers-and-staking.md)_._ \
  _- **Public IDO** - Select this option to raise funds and use a percentage of the raise to eventually list on a DEX. Requires community voting to get funded and investors must be staking in one of our_ [_Staking Tiers_](tiers-and-staking.md)_._ \
  _- **Degen** - This method allows anyone to create a project listing without staking BUIDL or community voting. It will be flagged as a degen listing to inform other users._
* _**Certified BUIDLer**_ - _This option eliminates the need for community voting. Select this if you have been approved by the Starter team as a Certified BUIDLer. Note: only pre-approved dev wallets given the Certified stamp can choose this option._&#x20;

## Voting Process (Detailed)

As soon as you have listed a project, your listing will be live in the voting area. It will then remain open until the time the IDO is about to start. Each holder only needs 10000 minimum BUIDL to vote.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/starter-voting.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For a project to list, it needs to have **20,000,000 net YES votes** during the voting phase (NET = Yes - No votes) where 1 Staked BUIDL = 1 vote, so if someone with 50000 BUIDL voted YES they would increase the number of the YES votes by 50000. Conversely, this same function works against the project when it is voted NO by the staker. **Only the STAKED amount of BUIDL by the investor will be reflected in the voting (So any BUIDL in a wallet will not count towards the vote).**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/pool-management-vote.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If the time for the IDO to launch comes and the pool does not have enough votes then it will cancel and you'll be refunded the tokens that you deposited when creating the pool.
